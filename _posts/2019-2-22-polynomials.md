For me, the easiest way to think about polynomials is not to think about them at all.

Well, except for the fact that you want to give them a number and get back either a 1 or a 0.

Jeremy Kun drops this conceptual bombshell in chapter 2: if you think of a polynomial as something that takes either a 0 or a 1, and returns either a 0 or a 1, then you can use polynomials to do Boolean algebra.

Obviously in real life polynomials can take all kinds of values and can return all kinds of values, but thinking this way lets us go to the next step, which is: what if I'm given a point (or more than one point) and want to figure out what kind of polynomial could have created it?

The general idea of a "point" in this context is: "I'll give you an X, and you give me the right Y."

If you're given a point (2, 3) then
